# Lasagna

## Ingredients

-   1 pound sweet Italian sausage
-   3/4 pound lean ground beef
-   1/2 cup minced onion
-   2 cloves garlic, crushed
-   1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
-   2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
-   2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
-   1/2 cup water
-   2 tablespoons white sugar
-   1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves
-   1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
-   1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
-   4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
-   12 lasagna noodles
-   1 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced or shredded.
-   1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

(Serves 12)

## Directions

* In a big pot, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium
  heat until well browned.
* Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
* Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1
  tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.
* Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
* Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
  noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
  with cold water.
* Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
* To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9Ã—13
  inch baking dish. Arrange 4 noodles over meat sauce. Cover with
  cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
  cheese.
* Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
  spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
* Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
  additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
