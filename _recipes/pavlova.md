  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line baking sheet with silicon mat.
    2. In a stand mixer with whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form (about 5 minutes).
    3. Add sugar in two additions, beating for 30 seconds between additions.
    4. Continue whisking on high speed until glossy stiff peaks form (about 2 minutes)
    5. Add the vanilla extract and beat for 1 more minute. The peaks should be very stiff.
    6. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the cream of tartar.
    7. Spread the pavlova mixture into an 8-9-inch circle. You can make decorative peaks with the back of a large spoon if desired. Make sure the edges are relatively tall and there is a nice dip in the center.
    8. Place pavlova in the oven. As soon as you close the oven door, reduce heat to 200°F. 
    9. Bake until the pavlova is firm and dry, about 90 minutes total. Rotate the baking sheet if you notice some spots browning. Try to limit how many times you open the oven as the cool air will interrupt the baking.
    10. Turn the oven off and let the pavlova cool inside the oven. Once the pavlova is cool, you can store it covered tightly at room temperature for up to 2 days. Or serve right away.
    11. Once cool, top the pavlova with whipped cream and assorted toppings. Slice and serve.
