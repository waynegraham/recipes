    **Meatballs**

    1. Mix all ingredients, adding enough bread crumbs so that mixture is still
    slightly wet. Mix only enough to incorporate ingredients, don't
    overwork.
    1. Form 1-2in. meatballs. Put to the side while you make sauce.

    **Sauce**
    1. Heat olive oil (2 circles around bottom of pan).
    1. Brown sausage slightly on both sides. You may have to do this in batches.
    1. Add onion and garlic and cook until translucent (do not brown).
    1. Add tomatoes. If using whole tomatoes squeeze tomatoes before adding to pot.
    1. Add remaining ingredients and stir thoroughly.
    1. Drop meatballs into sauce.
    1. Lower heat to bring just to a simmer. Don't cover **especially** if you are using whole tomatoes. This will allow the sauce to thicken.
    1. Cook, stirring often for several hours. (If you feel sauce sticking to the bottom of the pot when you stir, do not scrape the bottom while it is still cooking. You will get the burnt bits in the sauce. Just stir gently.)

# Pasta Sauce

This makes a lot; recommend making 1/2 a batch unless you're feeding *a lot* of people.
