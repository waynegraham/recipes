# Pasta Sauce

> This makes a lot; recommend making 1/2 a batch unless you're feeding a
> lot of people.


## Meatballs

### Ingredients

-   1 1/2 to 2 lbs. meatloaf mix
-   2 eggs
-   More or less 1/4 cup ketchup
-   seasoned bread crumbs
-   1/2 cup finely chopped fresh onion
-   2-3 tbs. minced parsley, dried or fresh
-   handful grated romano or parmesan cheese
-   salt and pepper

### Directions

Mix all ingredients, adding enough bread crumbs so that mixture is still
slightly wet. Mix only enough to incorporate ingredients, don't
overwork. Form 1-2in. meatballs. Put to the side while you make sauce.

## Sauce

### Ingredients

-   Olive oil
-   2 lbs. sweet Italian sausage
-   2 fresh pork hocks, or several meaty spare ribs or a wheel of cheese
    and parsley sausage, cut in pieces
-   1 large onion, diced (1-1 1/2 cups)
-   4-5 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
-   8 28oz. cans of Italian tomatoes or puree
-   Small can of tomato paste if using whole tomatoes
-   About 2 tbs. dried oregano
-   About 3 tbs. dried basil
-   salt and pepper
-   Large handful of grated Locatelli

### Directions

Heat olive oil (2 circles around bottom of pan). Brown sausage slightly
on both sides. You may have to do this in batches. Add onion and garlic
and cook until translucent (do not brown). Add tomatoes. If using whole
tomatoes squeeze tomatoes before adding to pot. Add remaining
ingredients and stir thoroughly.

Drop meatballs into sauce. Lower heat to bring just to a simmer. Don't
cover especially if you are using whole tomatoes. This will allow the
sauce to thicken. Cook, stirring often for several hours. (If you feel
sauce sticking to the bottom of the pot when you stir, do not scrape the
bottom while it is still cooking. You will get the burnt bits in the
sauce. Just stir gently.)
