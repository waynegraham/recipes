    1. Bring blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice, and maple syrup to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, just until blueberries begin to burst, about 5 minutes.
    1. Use a spoon to lightly mash about half of the berries to release their juices.
    1. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.
    1. Cook, stirring occasionally, until juices are reduced by half, 5–10 minutes.
    1. Remove jam from heat; taste and add a bit more maple syrup if you prefer it to be sweeter.
    1. Return to a boil, then stir in chia seeds; cook 1 minute to soften seeds.

    1. Cover and let cool completely.
