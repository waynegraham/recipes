    1. Measure out water and coffee (1:17 ratio)
    1. Place grounds in dripper
    1. Slowly we the grounds with 2x the amound of water (by weight) as coffee (e.g. 30g of grounds gets 60g water).
    1. Let it bloom for 30-45 seconds (to release carbon dioxide)
    1. Going in circular motion, try to get 60% of your liquid into the brewer in the next 30 seconds (300g by 1:15).
    1. The dripper should be about full, gently keep pouring water to keep it full.
    1. When it drains a bit, give it a bit of a swirl to ensure the coffee grounds form a flat bed.

You can get really fussy with coffee (or not), but a few things really go a long way for making a consistently *amazing* cup of coffee.

- Good beans
- The right grind
- The right proportion
- Temperature
- Water
- Time

## Beans
I like a medium roast on Ethiopian beans best; if you find a washed single-origin, there's a good chance it'll be good.

## Grind
Pourover grind is more coarse than you use for drip coffee, but not as coarse as a French press. If it's too fine, you will overextract (make it bitter and hollow), too coarse you will underextract (sour, acidic, salty).

## Proportion
You are shooting for a **1:17 weight (not volume) ratio** of coffee to water. The math here gets weird because it's typically done in grams. If you don't have a kitchen scale, 250g of water is about 1 1/2 cups of water and an 1/8 cup coffee measure is about 15g of coffee.

For **500g of coffee** (2 servings), I use **30g of coffee**.

## Temperature

Set this at **200F**. Caffeine extraction happens between 195 and 205.

## Water

You may want to experiment with filtered water if you have particularly hard water. Just don't use distilled (it'll eat your kettle).

## Time

This is probably the easiest way to see if your grind is doing. For a 500g brew, it should take about 2:30 minutes total once water is on (including the 30 second hydration).

# Quality of Life Improvements

- Scales: I use an Escali Primo (< $25). It doesn't do decimal parts of grams, but it's a consistent workhorse.
- A decent grinder like a [Baratzza Encore](https://baratza.com/grinder/encore/) is a huge leap forward in time saved from hand cranking. Fellow makes [Ode](https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder).
- A decanter is nice (I like the Hario V60 Drip Coffee Decanter)

# Terminology

There are three very popular types of pour over drippers: [Hario V60](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/drippers), [Kalita Wave](http://kalita.ae/products/waveseries/), and [Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/). Kalita has a reputation for being a bit easier to manage for beginners and the V60 needs a bit of technique.
