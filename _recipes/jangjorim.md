  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Prepare 1 pound (about 450 grams) of beef (flank part or round part) and cut it along the grain into 2×3 inch sized chunks.
    2. Soak the beef chunks in cold water.
    3. Put 4 cups of water into a thick-bottomed pot and bring to a boil.
    4. When the water boils, drain the beef and put it into the boiling water.
    5. Simmer it for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until the beef is tender.
    6. When the beef is fully cooked and tender, take out the beef chunks and wash and drain them in cold water.*tip*: If the beef is still tough after 50 minutes, add more water and cook longer. Poke the beef with a fork to see if it’s tender enough or not. The fork should go through the beef easily.
    7. Sieve the beef stock through a coffee filter or cheese cloth to get a clear broth.
    8. Put the beef chunks into the pot and add 2 cups of broth, ¾ cup soy sauce, ½ cup of garlic cloves, a few strips (4×5 cm) of dried kelp, 2 cups of shishito peppers, 1 tbs honey, and rest 3 eggs on top.
    9. Bring to a boil for 7 minutes over medium high heat.
    10. Open the lid and turn the eggs over so that the egg yolks will be in the center of the eggs when they are cooked.
    11. Cook another 10 minutes.
    12. Take out the eggs and rinse them in cold water. Crack the shells a bit by gently tapping each egg on your cutting board.
    13. Put the eggs back into the pot and stir so they are submerged. **tip**: the soy sauce juice will enter through the cracks and make a cool pattern on the eggs.
    14. Cook another 15 minutes and remove the pot from the heat.
    15. Take the eggs out and peel the shells off. You will see the beautiful pattern!
    16. Cool it down and keep it in the refrigerator.
