  ingredients_markdown: |-
    - 3 tbsp olive oil
    - 2 pounds Brussels sprouts, washed, trimmed and cut in half
    - 2 tbsp Butter
    - 1.5 tsp red chili flakes
    - 8 cloves Garlic, minced
    - 1 lemon, zest and juice
    - salt + pepper, to taste
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until oil is warm and shimmering.
    1. Add the Brussels sprouts, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, some caramelization is ok.
    1. Saut√© until fork tender, continuing to stir occasionally. I like my Brussels sprouts on the softer side, so I cooked mine for a little longer (approx. 20 minutes).
    1. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the butter, chili flakes, and garlic. Mix well.
    1. Remove from heat and stir in the fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
