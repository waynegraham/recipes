# Red Sauce

This has meatballs that simmer in the sauce. This makes a lot, so maybe
half everything

## Meatballs

- 1 1/2 to 2 lbs meatload mix
- 2 eggs
- ~ 1/4 cup ketchup
- seasoned bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh onion
- 2 - 3 Tbs minced parsely (dried or fresh)
- Handful of romano or parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper

Mix all the ingredients and enough bread crumbs so the mixture is
slightly wet. Don't overwork, just enough to incorporate. Form 1-2 inch
meatballs. Put aside while making sauce.
