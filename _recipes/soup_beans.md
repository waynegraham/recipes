recipe:
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    - 1 pound dried pinto beans
    - 1 ½ teaspoons country ham or bacon drippings
    - 8 ounces streaked meat (sliced fatback), diced
    - 1 large Vidalia onion
    - 2 fresh bay leaves
    - 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
    - 1 teaspoon dried turmeric
    - 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
    - 2 ½ tablespoons hot sauce
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Pick through the beans to discard any chaff, funky ones, or pebbles, and then rinse them. Place in a large bowl and add enough water to cover to a depth of 3 inches. Let stand overnight, and then drain.
    1. Heat the ham fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the streaked meat and cook, stirring occasionally, until it renders, browns, and begins to crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towels.
    1. Add the onion to the pot and stir to coat in the fat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes.
    1. Stir in the beans, and pour in water to cover by a depth of 1 inch. Stir in the bay leaves, pepper, turmeric, salt, and hot sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, partially cover the pot, and cook the beans at a gentle simmer until tender and creamy, about 1 hour. Begin checking for doneness every 5 minutes after they have cooked for 45 minutes.
    1. Discard the bay leaves, stir in the rendered meat, and check the seasoning. Serve soon, or cool, cover, and refrigerate for up to four days. The beans get softer and their liquid more creamy each time they are heated, which many people prefer.
