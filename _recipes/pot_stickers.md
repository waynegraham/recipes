- 1 1/2 cups finely chopped green cabbage

## Dough

- 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour

## Sauce

# Directions

## Filling
Mix the filling together until combined with a fork. Wrap with plastic and place in fridge while you work on the dough.

## Dough

Place ingredients in a bowl and mix until it is a shaggy dough. Kneed (and flour) until dough is elastic (3-5 minutes). Wrap in plastic and let set for 30 minutes.

Divide in to four sections.

Take each section and roll out in to the thickness of your thumb and divide in to 6 pieces. Roll each piece to about 3 1/2 inches wide.

Moisten the outside 1/2 inch with water and place a scoop of the filling in the middle. Pleat the sides.

## Cooking

On medium-high heat, pan fry for about 2 1/2 minutes (or until bottoms are golden brown).

Add a couple tablespoons of water and cover to steam for ~3 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium and remove cover and allow to cook until the water is gone and the bottoms are golden brown.
