## Ingredients

- 1 roasting chicken, cut into pieces (you can also just use 3-4 whole chicken breasts)
- 3 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon cilantro, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1  large onion, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 3 lbs yucca root, peeled and chopped into bite-sized pieces (also called cassava)
- 4 cups chicken stock (the kind bought in a box is fine)
- salt and pepper

## Directions

- Rinse the chicken and pat dry.
- In a small bowl, mix the salt, cilantro, oregano, garlic, and olive oil. Rub the mix all over the chicken and let it marinate for 10 minutes.
- In the meantime, peel and chop the yucca and the onion. Set aside.
- Heat a large pot over medium heat. Place the chicken in the pot, place a lid on it, and let it sweat for about 7 minutes.
- Add the onion and the chicken stock. Bring the soup to a boil and then let it simmer over medium low heat until the chicken is cooked through and soft.
- Raise the heat to medium and add the yucca. Bring the pot to a gentle simmer and cook until the yucca is cooked through (approximately 10 minutes).
- Serve with white rice on the side that is added into the soup when you are about to eat it.
NOTE: This soup keeps well frozen and only gets more flavorful with time.
