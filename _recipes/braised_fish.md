  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Generously salt fish and rinse under water to clean it. Set aside to try. If using a fish other than catfish (any clean fish will work), you can generally skip this step, but the salt on catfish step helps reduce the "slime" the forms on catfish.
    1. Add oil to a heavy bottom pan and sauté the garlic over medium heat until lightly toasted.
    1. Layer shallots and fish on top of garlic (in that order). Try to evenly space the fish.
    1. Add seasoning and cooking liquid and bring to boil on high.
    1. Turn down heat to a simmer for ~20 minutes.
    1. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
    1. Gently flip the filets and simmer for ~10 minutes with a lid partially covering the pan.
    1. Be sure to pay attention to this last bit. If carmelizing (you can also just poach this) this is the part where it can burn. Just pay attention and spoon sauce over the fish if needed.
    1. Add green onion during the last 2 minutes to wilt.
    1. Serve over rice. Top with sliced chilies and freshly ground black pepper.

I didn't have coconut juice or coconut soda, so I improvised with coconut water and brown sugar (palm sugar would have been better). I did 3/4 cup of coconut water and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.
