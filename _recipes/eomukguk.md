## Ingredients

- 1 lbs fish cakes
- 4 or 5 wooden skewers

## Broth

### Ingredients

- 12 cups of water
- 1/2 lbs Korean radish
- 20 large dried anchovies (remove guts)
- 1 cup diced onion
- 1 sheet dried kelp (7"x8")
- 2 ts soy sauce
- 1 ts salt

### Directions

- Put the water in a large pot.
- Peel the radish and cut it into 1 inch cubes (or balls) and put them into a soup strainer (gukmulmang). Put the strainer into the pot. If you don’t have a soup strainer, you can use soup sock or cheese cloth.
- Add the the onion, dried kelp, and the leftover bits of radish (including the skin) to the pot. Bring it to a boil over high heat for 20 minutes with the lid closed.
- While it’s boiling, cook the anchovies in the microwave for 1 minute (or sauté without oil in a pan for a few minutes).
- Add the dried anchovies to the pot and boil for another for 20 minutes, uncovered. This will allow some of the fishy smell of the anchovies to evaporate.
- Remove the pot from the heat and strain. Take out the cooked radish cubes from the soup strainer and set aside. You’ll get about 8 cups of stock. Add the soy sauce and salt and mix well.

Add the fish cakes:

- Stick 5 or 6 fishcake pieces on a skewer, and make 4 or 5 skewers. Put them in a shallow pot and add enough broth to totally submerge the fishcakes.
- Bring to a boil for 10 to 15 minutes until the fishcakes are soft.

## Dipping Sauce (yangnyeomjang)

### Ingredients
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ½ ts sugar
- 1 ts hot pepper flakes
- 1 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 green onion,chopped
- 1 green chili pepper (or jalapeño), chopped
- 1 ts toasted sesame oil
- 1 ts toasted sesame seeds

### Directions

- Combine soy sauce, hot pepper flakes, green onion, green chili pepper, garlic, sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds in a small mixing bowl.
