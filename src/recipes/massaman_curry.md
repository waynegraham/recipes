In a heavy bottom pot, reduce 1 cup of the coconut milk until it ‚Äúbreaks.‚Äù Add the curry paste to the broken coconut milk and saut√© until aromatic. Alternatively, if you are using canned coconut milk or a type that is not 100% coconut milk, it may have been homogenized and may not break. In this case, saut√© the curry paste in some vegetable oil, and add 1/4 cup of the coconut milk to loosen it up.

Toss the chicken in the saut√©ed curry paste, and add the remaining amount of coconut milk. Add just enough water to cover the chicken pieces. Add 1 Tbsp of fish sauce, 2 Tbsp tamarind juice, and 2 Tbsp chopped palm sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Let simmer for 20 minutes.

Add the potatoes and onion, and let simmer gently for another 20 minutes or until the vegetables and chicken are fork tender.

When the cooking is done, add the roasted peanuts and do a final taste check. Adjust by adding more fish sauce (for salty), tamarind (for acid), and sugar (for sweet). Serve with rice!
