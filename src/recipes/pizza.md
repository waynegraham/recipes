## Dough

1. Bloom yeast in warm water.
2. Mix flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl.
3. Add yeast mixture and olive oil in the bowl.
4. Knead with bread hook until smooth (about a minute).
5. Add tablespoons of flour if dough is particularly sticky
6. Coat with oil and cover.
7. Let rise until doubled in size (about an hour)
8. Punch down
9. Make in to pizza round

### Sauce

Mix everything in a bowl and let site for at least 15 minutes. Adjust to taste.

### Pizza

1. Place rack on the highest level (if it's too close, put it down one)
1. Preheat oven as high as it will go, with large cast iron pan in it
1. Once preheated, pull the skillet out and put pizza round in the pan
1. Put sauce and toppings on pizza
1. Put back in oven for about 7 minutes until edges are nice
1. Rip fresh basil on the pizza

If you can be patient, letting the dough ferment for a day (and making it with sough dough starter) makes a much better crust.
