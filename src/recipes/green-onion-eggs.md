Cut spring onions into small round pieces.

Take out a frying pan and place on a medium heat.

Put in some sesame oil.

Once the oil is hot, place green onion pieces in.

When the oil begins to sizzle in the green onion, crack two eggs into the pan.

Try to separate the two eggs with your spatula.

Gently pour some of the soup soy sauce over the eggs.

Cook it to the consistency you like.
