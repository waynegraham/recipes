Prepare the vegetables as specified.

Cut the tofu into about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick cubes.

Heat a large pan with 2 tablespoons of oil over medium high heat. Add the onion, 1/2 of the chopped scallion, garlic, and gochugaru, and stir-fry until fragrant, 2 - 3 minutes.

Add the meat, and cook until the meat is no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon, 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the soy sauce, doenjang, gochujang, and sugar and stir to blend with the meat. Add the bell peppers and cook briefly until slightly softened.

Add 1-1/2 cups of water to the pan, and bring it to a boil.

Then, slide the tofu into the pan, gently stirring to spread into a single layer. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, gently stirring 2 to 3 times to make sure the tofu doesn’t stick to the pan.

Gently stir in the starch slurry to thicken the sauce, and then the sesame oil. Cook for another minute or so to bring everything together. Garnish with the remaining scallion, and serve hot with steamed rice.
