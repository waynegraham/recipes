## Sausage

Break off partially frozen ground pork and pork fat and place them into the food processor. Add sugar, fish sauce, garlic, shallot, rice powder, corn starch, baking powder, curing powder and ice. Process for about 10 minutes on high until you get a smooth, light pink, homogeneous pork paste.

Using rubber gloves, spread pork paste on a large baking sheet, one-inch in height.

Bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes. To get nice caramelization, turn the oven to broil for 5-10 minutes.

Cut into stripes and serve on its own or part of other Vietnamese dishes.

## Sauce

Heat up oil in a medium-size saucepan. 

Add garlic and shallot and fry until fragrant. 

Add ground pork, making sure to break up any clumps with a wooden spoon. 

Add water, sugar, bouillon powder, salt to taste, and rice powder. 

Whisk until thicken.
