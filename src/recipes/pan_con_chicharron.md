 ## Pork

Make a brine with water and salt. Add pork and brine overnight in the fridge.

Discard brine the next day.

Place pork in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the pork by 1 inch (~10 cups)

Add quartered onion and bay leaf, bring to a simmer partially covered. Let water reduce completely (~2 hours).

When the braising liquid has completely evaporated, continue to cook the pork in its own fat for a few minutes to brown it. Remove from heat and set aside.

Remove the meat from the bone and cut into 4 large pieces.

## Salsa Criolla

Place 2 sweet potato rounds in each bun, topped with a piece of pork, and garnished with the onion and habanero salsa and a few cilantro leaves.
