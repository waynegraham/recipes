# Soup

Put the water in a large pot.

Peel the radish and cut it into 1 inch cubes (or balls) and put them into a soup strainer (gukmulmang). Put the strainer into the pot. If you donâ€™t have a soup strainer, you can use soup sock or cheese cloth.

Add the the onion, dried kelp, and the leftover bits of radish (including the skin) to the pot. Bring it to a boil over high heat for 20 minutes with the lid closed.

While itâ€™s boiling, cook the anchovies in the microwave for 1 minute (or sautÃ© without oil in a pan for a few minutes).

Add the dried anchovies to the pot and boil for another for 20 minutes, uncovered. This will allow some of the fishy smell of the anchovies to evaporate.

 Remove the pot from the heat and strain. Take out the cooked radish cubes from the soup strainer and set aside. Youâ€™ll get about 8 cups of stock. Add the soy sauce and salt and mix well.

Add the fish cakes

Stick 5 or 6 fishcake pieces on a skewer, and make 4 or 5 skewers. Put them in a shallow pot and add enough broth to totally submerge the fishcakes.

Bring to a boil for 10 to 15 minutes until the fishcakes are soft.

## Dipping Sauce

Combine soy sauce, hot pepper flakes, green onion, green chili pepper, garlic, sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds in a small mixing bowl.
