1. Cut the stems off 30 garlic cloves.
2. Split each clove into three pieces with a knife.
3. Take out a mixing bowl and place in corn syrup, soy sauce and mirin. Mix together well.
4. Then take out a frying pan and place it on a medium heat. Pour in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
5. Place the sliced garlic cloves in. Mix around in the pan until most of the garlic slices get a nice golden brown color.
6. Then take them out of the pan and onto a plate.
7. Mix the sauce one more time and place into the frying pan. The sauce will begin to reduce and get bubbly. At this time, pour the garlic cloves back into the frying pan with the sauce. Mix the garlic pieces around to coat them thoroughly in the sauce.
8. Turn off the heat.
9. Garnish with sesame seeds.
