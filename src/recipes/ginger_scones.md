1. Preheat oven to 400°F (or 200°C).
2. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. In a large bowl vigorously whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
4. Stir in the candied ginger, lemon zest, and fresh ginger until evenly mixed.
5. Create a well in the center of the flour, pour in the melted butter and the buttermilk. Gently mix with a wooden spoon until the flour mixture is just moistened. Don't over-mix! The mixture should look very shaggy.
6. Divide the mixture into two balls, and flatten each onto a floured surface into a 1-inch thick, 6-inch wide circle. Slice each round into 6 wedges.
7. Transfer to the parchment paper-lined baking sheet, spacing at least an inch apart.
8. Sprinkle with coarse sugar (optional).
9. Bake at 400°F (or 200°C) for 18-20 minutes.
10. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes before eating.
To store, allow first to cool to room temperature, then seal in a freezer bag.
