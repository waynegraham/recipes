Measure out water and coffee (1:17 ratio)

Place grounds in dripper

Slowly we the grounds with 2x the amound of water (by weight) as coffee (e.g. 30g of grounds gets 60g water).

Let it bloom for 30-45 seconds (to release carbon dioxide)

Going in circular motion, try to get 60% of your liquid into the brewer in the next 30 seconds (300g by 1:15).

The dripper should be about full, gently keep pouring water to keep it full.

When it drains a bit, give it a bit of a swirl to ensure the coffee grounds form a flat bed.

You can get really fussy with coffee (or not), but a few things really go a long way for making a consistently *amazing* cup of coffee.

- Good beans
- The right grind
- The right proportion
- Temperature
- Water
- Time

## Beans

I like a medium roast on Ethiopian beans best; if you find a washed single-origin, there's a good chance it'll be good.

## Grind

Pourover grind is more coarse than you use for drip coffee, but not as coarse as a French press. If it's too fine, you will overextract (make it bitter and hollow), too coarse you will underextract (sour, acidic, salty).

## Proportion

You are shooting for a **1:17 weight (not volume) ratio** of coffee to water. The math here gets weird because it's typically done in grams. If you don't have a kitchen scale, 250g of water is about 1 1/2 cups of water and an 1/8 cup coffee measure is about 15g of coffee.

For **500g of coffee** (2 servings), I use **30g of coffee**.

## Temperature

Set this at **200F**. Caffeine extraction happens between 195 and 205.

## Water

You may want to experiment with filtered water if you have particularly hard water. Just don't use distilled (it'll eat your kettle).

## Time

This is probably the easiest way to see if your grind is doing. For a 500g brew, it should take about 2:30 minutes total once water is on (including the 30 second hydration).

## Quality of Life Improvements

- Scales: I use an Escali Primo (< $25). It doesn't do decimal parts of grams, but it's a consistent workhorse.
- A decent grinder like a [Baratzza Encore](https://baratza.com/grinder/encore/) is a huge leap forward in time saved from hand cranking. Fellow makes [Ode](https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder).
- A decanter is nice (I like the Hario V60 Drip Coffee Decanter)

## Terminology

There are three very popular types of pour over drippers: [Hario V60](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/drippers), [Kalita Wave](http://kalita.ae/products/waveseries/), and [Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/). Kalita has a reputation for being a bit easier to manage for beginners and the V60 needs a bit of technique.
