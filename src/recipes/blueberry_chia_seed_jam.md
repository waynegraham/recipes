Bring blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice, and maple syrup to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, just until blueberries begin to burst, about 5 minutes.

Use a spoon to lightly mash about half of the berries to release their juices.

Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until juices are reduced by half, 5â€“10 minutes.

Remove jam from heat; taste and add a bit more maple syrup if you prefer it to be sweeter.

Return to a boil, then stir in chia seeds; cook 1 minute to soften seeds.

Let jam cool slightly, then transfer to heatproof jars or containers.

Cover and let cool completely.

Chill until ready to use.
