Put the chicken in the freezer for 10 minutes. Chop with a knife.

Fry chicken in vegetable oil (or rendered chicken fat if you have it) until just done. Add shallots, garlic, and chillies and cook until fragrant.

Add the sauce and cook until it starts to thicken.

Add basil and cook until the basil has wilted.
