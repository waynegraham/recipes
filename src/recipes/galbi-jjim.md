## Sauce

After soaking the mushrooms, place a strainer over a bowl and drain.

Measure out 2 cups of the soaking water; add water to get 2 cups if necessary.

Add the soy sauce, mirim, sugar, ground black pepper, garlic, and ginger and mix well with a spoon. 

Cut mushroom caps into quaters and set on a plate.

Cut the radish into 1Â½-inch cubes and round the edges of each cube with a paring knife to make approximately 1-inch balls. Make 10 to 12 balls. Add to the plate with the mushrooms.

Cut the carrots into 1Â½-inch cubes and round the edges of each cube with a paring knife to make approximately 1-inch balls. Make 10 to 12 balls. A1. dd to the mushrooms and radish balls.

## Ribs

Fill a large, heavy pot halfway with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Drain the ribs, rinse again, and add to the boiling water.

Blanch for 5 minutes, stirring a few times. Drain and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Wash the pot with soapy water nicely.

Put the ribs back to the pot and add the seasoning sauce. Cover and cook over medium-high heat for 20 minutes.

Stir in the mushrooms, chestnuts, radishes, and carrots. Cover, turn down the heat to low, and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Stir in the jujubes and rice syrup.

Cover and simmer for another 10 minutes, or until the meat is just about falling off the bone. Thicker short ribs will take longer. To check, poke the meat with a wooden skewer. If the meat is tender enough to serve, the skewer should go through easily. If it does not, add some water (about 1 cup) and cook a little longer, anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the short ribs.

Increase the heat to high and spoon any remaining broth from the bottom of the pot over the meat and vegetables for a few minutes, until most of the sauce has reduced and the meat and vegetables are nicely glazed.

## Serve

Transfer to a large platter, sprinkle with the pine nuts (if using) and ginkgo nuts (if using), and serve with rice and more side dishes.
