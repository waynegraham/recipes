1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until oil is warm and shimmering.
2. Add the Brussels sprouts, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, some caramelization is ok.
3. SautÃ© until fork tender, continuing to stir occasionally. I like my Brussels sprouts on the softer side, so I cooked mine for a little longer (approx. 20 minutes).
4. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the butter, chili flakes, and garlic. Mix well.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
