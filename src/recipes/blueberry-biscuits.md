## Biscuits

Preheat oven to 450.

In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients with butter and shortening. Use a pastry brush (or your hands) to combine until the mixture looks like crumbs. 

Make a well in the center an pur in the buttermilk. 

Stir the dough until it comes together.

Turn dough onto a floured surface and dust with flour. Roll out and laminate 5 or 6 times. 

On the last lamination, spread blueberries on to the dough evenly. Press the blueberrys gently into the dough and finish the lamination.

Transfer the dough onto a 1/2 sheet and cut into 6 pieces (do not seperate).

Bake until done (~15 minutes)

## Frosting

In a stand mixer, cream cream cheese and butter.

Add vanilla extract and salt. Stir to combine.

Slowly add sugar until desired sweetness.

Wait until the biscuits have completely cooled to frost the biscuits.

> Some lemon zest in the icing and/or dough may be a good addition.
