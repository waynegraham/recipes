Preheat the oven to 350

Heat some oil in a large skillet.

Peel the plantains and cut them in to thin slices.

Fry until golden brown.

Remove from pan and place on paper towels to drain.

Line the bottom and edges of a 9x13 casserole with the plantain slices. Reserve some for the top.

Brown the meat in the skillet.

Add the onion, celery, green peppers, garlic, and coriander. Fry until fragrant.

Add the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, olives, salt and chili pepper.

Add 3/4 cup of water and cook, stirring occasionally until the meat is soft and almost dry.

Carefully place the meat in the casserole over the plantains.

Cover the meat with the remaining plantain slices.

Beat the eggs and cover the plantains.

Bake for approximately 45 minutes.

Serve immediately
