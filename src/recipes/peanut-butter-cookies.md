Preheat oven to 350.

In a medium bowl, whisk flour, salt, and baking soda. Set aside.

In the standing mixer with paddle attachment, beat peanut butter and butter until smooth.

Add sugars and cream. 

Add egg and vanilla extract and mix until incorporated.

Add flour mixture and mix until *just* combined. **Do not overmix!**

Use a cookie scoop and make on lined tray for 8-13 minutes. The middles will look soft and the edges should look set, but not golden. 

If the cookies look puffy, genltly bang the page on the counter a few times.

Let the cookies cool on the sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to cooling rack to cool completely.
