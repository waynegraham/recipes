Marinade chicken in soy sauce, Golden Mountain sauce, and black soy sauce for 15-20 minutes.

In a wok, sauté garlic and ginger in vegetable oil over medium high heat until garlic starts to turn golden. Add chicken and toss until the exterior looks done.

Add palm sugar and pepper, then toss until sugar is dissolved and chicken is completely cooked.
